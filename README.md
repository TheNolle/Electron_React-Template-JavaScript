# Electron x React

**Electron x React** is an Electron-based app template that allows you to create desktop applications using ReactJS for the frontend, SCSS or CSS, and Node.js. This template enables you to develop without relying on Create-React-App and provides a simple way to build and package your application for multiple platforms.

## Features
* ReactJS integration for frontend development
* SCSS and CSS support
* Latest Node.js and ElectronJS versions
* Live reloading during development
* Secure interactions with Node.js and other packages
* Automatic packaging for Windows, Linux, and macO


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (preferably version 20.0.0)
* PNPM (optional, for faster package management)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install all the dependencies by running `npm install` or `pnpm install`.

### Running the App
* For production mode, run `npm start` or `pnpm run start`.
* For development mode, run `npm run dev` or `pnpm run start dev`.


## Configuration
The only configuration files you may need to customize are the `package.json` file for the app name and app id, and the `public/index.html` file for the display name.


## Development Process
* Develop the Electron app as you normally would, using ReactJS instead of plain HTML and JS.
* We recommend using Visual Studio Code as the IDE and backing up your work with a version control system (like GitHub or GitLab).


## Preloader and Live Reloading
* The Electron preloader file is used to preload content.
* Live reloading is enabled using a local live server running on a specific port that no other service uses, and displaying it directly in the app.


## Security
* Context isolation and the preloader are used to ensure secure interactions with Node.js and other packages.
* Remember to double-check the utility of a code, clean up after yourself, and follow other best practices as needed.


## Building and Packaging
* To build the app for production, run `npm run package` or `pnpm run package`. This uses the electron-builder function.
* The app is automatically packaged for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
